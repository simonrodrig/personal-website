## Problem
This project was done for a non-technical design class I took during my
undergraduate studies named "Design Matters." It was a hands-on introduction
to the concept of Human Centered Design, and specifically tasked with equipping
students with the knowledge to develop products that meaningfully solve
problems for a consumer. The course was open to people of any major, and is
structured as the first course for a design minor offered at my university. I
had a unique background in this course being one of only a few students from the
engineering department, which gave me a unique skillset to apply in this area.

The task was to engage in the design process, including discovery, brainstorming,
feedback, and development, to improve the experience of "snacking" on the campus
of my university. As part of this project, we were to interview a sample of
students who were not in the course about their snacking experience and learn
about what experiences they liked and disliked in order to develop a product
that meaningfully improved the experience. Throughout this experience we were
constantly in the process of brainstorming ideas, prototyping them, and then
collecting feedback from possible users in order to improve on the prototype.
Finally, we were to present our findings and demonstrate our final idea for a
product that would address the given problem. This was not unlike the typical
experience of "Agile" development in the software engineering space.

## Approach
Part of the research process included interviews, where we conducted both
one-on-one interviews, as well as what are called "Ethnographic" interviews,
which are done with people in the places where they are already engaging with
that activity. Overe the course of our research, we discovered that many of the
primary issues with "snacking" on our college campus revolved around both the
diversity of the snacks available on campus as well as simply the availability
of those snacks. This case study was conducted during the second semester after
the pandemic began, and notably many of the ways students were able to snack
was disrupted by measures to enforce social distancing. Many students desired
more healthy options and were often seeking "freshness" from their food. They
posited that it would be easier to maintain healthier eating habits if it was
simply easier to obtain fresh foods on campus, and if that experience itself was
enjoyable.

## Solution
For this project, we went through one round of ideation, collected feedback on
four of our ideas, then selected a final idea based on our feedback that would
best solve the problem space.

Our final idea was to utilize the various outdoor tents that were set up outside
dining halls at the time and reinvent them to resemble a cross between a farmer's
market and a buffet. Students would walk through a line collecting fresh
ingredients, then exit the tent where those ingredients could be grilled,
turned into a salad, or blended together as a smoothie. This solution would not
only give students a way to access fresh ingredients on campus, but also to
transform those ingredients into a snack, and make the experience fun as well.

Being a software developer, I also contributed some work on an app-based food
voting concept, allowing students to upvote ideas for the farmer's market and
be able to adjust the variety of foods to suit their needs. Though writing code
was outside of the scope of this project, I was able to produce some prototype
wireframes in Figma in order to showcase the concept of voting for different
foods.
