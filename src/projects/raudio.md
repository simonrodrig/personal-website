## Problem
This project was conducted for an 
[open source software development course](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40677.sp22/).
The goals of this course were to familiarize students with the process and
culture of software development in the open source field as well as introduce
many of the practical tools and language that is often not covered in college
courses. This includes the GitHub issue/pull-request workflow, as well as
choosing an open source license,
